# Color Grid Game (working title)

The color grid game allows users to generate a customizable grid consisting of differently-colored tiles. This is an exciting way to explore and enjoy colors. Users can take it a step further--they can then choose to make this grid into a puzzle game that randomizes the grid so that they can put it back together in the correct order.

[This codepen](https://codepen.io/riseerpelding/pen/mdOoyZN) contains most of the work I've done on this so far.


## Features
* Create a color grid by picking 4 corner colors and a grid size (small, medium, large)
* Play the puzzle game with your grid (or pick from presets) - put the grid back in order!

### Technologies used/Technologies I'm interested in
* [Some kind of color picker library](https://blog.logrocket.com/color-picker-libraries-to-use-in-2021/)
* Maybe Vue because I haven't used it before? Or React because I have and I want some pro tips? (I am also really curious about using React Native if that is on the table at all--although that might be out of scope for the apprenticeship?)
* Beyond that, open to whatever seems like it might lend itself well to this.
