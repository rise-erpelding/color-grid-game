# Color Grid Game

### What does the game do?
* Allows you to generate a color grid (optionally) - a much more polished, embellished version of the CodePen
  * You generate this color grid by picking 4 corner colors
  * It would be really nice if there were a color picker that could be utilized to do this
  * Then you can pick from several preset sizes for the grid, for instance, a 4x4, 8x8, 16x16 (small, medium, large)
  * Then it creates a grid of tiles with the 4 picked colors in each corner and tiles in between that gradually change from one corner color to the other
* ORR the grids come pre-made and you pick the one you like and the size (I like this idea a lot less and would be happy to make it just a grid generating playground as an MVP before a game)
* The game then shows you the grid with the colors put in order, then scrambles the tiles in the grid. It is then up to the player to put them back together in the right order by switching each misplaced tile with the one that goes in its spot.
* The player will receive some kind of feedback so that they know when the tile is in the correct place, maybe a dot or some marker on the correctly (or incorrectly) placed tile.
